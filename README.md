# Recursion
## Challenge 3

In the `problems` folder find 8 problems with `TODO`s enclosed. 

**The last two are especially challenging.**

> Late work will not be accepted unless you [apply a token](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefo2mnYhrX1h6TB6kZvhu1SCYY7H2CMK0BtuorrpMojqqKnQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) at least 24 hours before the deadline. You get two tokens in this class: one that can be applied during the first half the semester, and one that can be applied during the second half of the semester.

## Testing and Grading

If you have Gatorgrade installed locally, you can test your assignment by running `gatorgrade` in Terminal. You can also run the individual python files. 

To receive a **satisfactory** grade on this assignment: 

- [ ] Pass all gatorchecks for 6 of 8 problems
- [ ] Use recursion in solving each problem
- [ ]  Answer 2/3 verbal questions correctly in the lab session after the deadline. You will not be able to look at your code while answering questions, so it is a good idea to review your assignment right before lab.
